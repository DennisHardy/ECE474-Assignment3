Description: Using the LIST_R scheduling algorithm, and a list of required operations and their variables, we are to create a High Level State Machine (HLSM) that synthesizes in Verilog.

Contribution: I mean it's not perfect Communism or anything, but everybody at least did something.

Zac Alvarez handled the output file formatting, generation of the HLSM, HLSM behavior, nesting if and else statements and assisted in debugging

Dennis Hardy handled the initial framework of the project, including header and cpp files as well as most of the basic functionality involving ALAP scheduling used to determine LIST_R scheduling values

Tommy Salanski handled a lot of the ece3 testing and assisted with compatibility, providing valuable feedback as well as general debugging, and testing in Verilog to ensure that final outputs didn't have errors

Zi Wang handled LIST_R scheduling and assisted in debugging
